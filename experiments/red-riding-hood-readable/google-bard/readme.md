Sure, here is a readable version of the Little Red Riding Hood story from American Literature:

Once upon a time, there was a dear little girl who lived with her mother in a pretty little cottage on the edge of a dark and gloomy forest. The little girl's name was Little Red Riding Hood, and she was so sweet and kind that everyone who knew her loved her.

One day, Little Red Riding Hood's mother asked her to take a basket of food to her grandmother, who lived on the other side of the forest. Little Red Riding Hood was happy to help her mother, and she set off into the forest with the basket of food.

As Little Red Riding Hood was walking through the forest, she met a wolf. The wolf was very cunning, and he pretended to be friendly to Little Red Riding Hood. He asked her where she was going, and Little Red Riding Hood told him that she was going to her grandmother's house.

The wolf then told Little Red Riding Hood that he was going to the same place, and he offered to walk with her. Little Red Riding Hood was a little bit scared, but she agreed to let the wolf walk with her.

The wolf and Little Red Riding Hood walked through the forest together, and the wolf told Little Red Riding Hood stories. Little Red Riding Hood was so engrossed in the wolf's stories that she didn't notice that the wolf was leading her off the path.

When they finally reached Little Red Riding Hood's grandmother's house, the wolf told Little Red Riding Hood to wait outside while he went inside to see her grandmother. Little Red Riding Hood waited outside, and she soon heard the wolf howling.

Little Red Riding Hood went inside the house to see what was wrong, and she found the wolf wearing her grandmother's clothes. The wolf had eaten her grandmother, and he was now pretending to be her.

Little Red Riding Hood was very scared, but she was also very clever. She pretended not to be afraid of the wolf, and she asked him why he had such big ears. The wolf said that he had big ears so that he could hear better.

Little Red Riding Hood then asked the wolf why he had such big eyes. The wolf said that he had big eyes so that he could see better.

Finally, Little Red Riding Hood asked the wolf why he had such big teeth. The wolf said that he had big teeth so that he could eat her.

Little Red Riding Hood ran out of the house as fast as she could, and the wolf chased after her. Little Red Riding Hood ran to a nearby woodcutter's cottage, and the woodcutter came out and killed the wolf.

Little Red Riding Hood was safe, and she went back home to her mother. She told her mother what had happened, and her mother was very proud of her for being so clever.

Little Red Riding Hood never went into the forest alone again, and she always listened to her mother's advice.
